# Hospital Medicine Management System.
#### Vedio demo:
#### Description:
The Hospital Medicine Management System is a console-based software application developed using the C++ programming language. This project is designed to help hospitals, clinics, and medical stores manage their medicine records in an organized and efficient manner. The main goal of this system is to replace manual record-keeping with a computerized solution that is faster, more accurate, and easier to use.
In many hospitals, medicine records are often maintained manually, which can lead to problems such as data loss, incorrect entries, and difficulty in tracking medicine stock. This system solves those problems by maintaining all medicine-related information digitally. Each medicine record contains important details such as medicine ID, medicine name, dosage, and available quantity, ensuring that all necessary information is stored in one place.
The program works through a menu-driven interface, where the user is presented with a list of options. The user can select any option by entering a number, making the system simple and user-friendly even for beginners. The entire system is designed to be interactive, allowing users to perform multiple operations without restarting the program.
All medicine data is stored using structures and arrays, which helps in organizing the data efficiently. Structures allow grouping related information of a medicine together, while arrays allow storing multiple medicine records. This approach makes data handling easier and improves program readability.
Detailed Features of the System
1. Add Medicine Feature
This feature allows users to add new medicines to the system. When this option is selected, the user is asked to enter the medicine ID, medicine name, dosage, and quantity. Once the data is entered, it is stored in the system and becomes available for further operations. This feature helps in building and maintaining the medicine database.
2. View Medicine List Feature
The view medicine list feature displays all stored medicine records in a clear tabular format. It shows each medicine’s ID, name, dosage, and quantity. This feature helps hospital staff quickly check the available stock and identify which medicines are running low or are fully stocked.
3. Update Medicine Feature
The update medicine feature allows users to modify existing medicine records. If there is any change in medicine name, dosage, or quantity, the user can update the information easily. This ensures that the system always contains accurate and up-to-date records, which is very important in hospital management.
4. Delete Medicine Feature
This feature is used to remove medicines that are no longer required or are discontinued. By deleting unnecessary records, the system remains clean and well-organized. This also prevents confusion caused by outdated or unused medicine entries.
5. Take Medicine (Dispense) Feature
The take medicine feature is used when a medicine is issued to a patient. When this option is selected, the system reduces the quantity of the selected medicine automatically. If the quantity becomes zero, the system displays an out-of-stock message, alerting the user that the medicine is no longer available. This feature helps prevent issuing medicines that are not in stock.
Programming Concepts Used
This project makes effective use of important Programming Fundamentals concepts, including:
Functions for modular programming
Structures to store medicine data
Arrays to manage multiple records
Pointers for efficient data handling
Loops for repeated operations
Conditional statements for decision making
These concepts make the code modular, readable, and easy to maintain.
Overall Conclusion
The Hospital Medicine Management System is a practical and useful C++ project that demonstrates how basic programming concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems. The system is efficient, user-friendly, and suitable for small to medium-scale hospital or medical store environments. This project not only improves medicine stock management but also strengthens understanding of core C++ programming concepts.
